# Sound Source Localization

Research project carried out as part of a student research group, aiming to analyze beamforming algorithms for the localization of a moving sound source.

## Project Objectives
1.  **Comparative Analysis of Beamforming Algorithms:**
    - DAS
    - Functional Beamforming
    - MUSIC
    - Capon

2.  **Impact of Microphone Array Geometry on Sound Source Localization:**
    - Planar and volumetric matrices

3.  **Impact of other factors**
    - Environment and setup

The study was conducted in a Python environment using the Acoular library.
